# Trivia Game: Numbers in other languages

### Here is the link to the live website: [Trivia Game: What is the number in another language?](https://tylercasperson.github.io/TriviaGame/)

## When I was studying linguistics in college, an additional thing some of the professors did while pairing us up for activities was to have us count in a different language. The words were simple and we needed to be paired up in groups. This helped us loosen our pronounciation and learn a small part of another language. The best way to learn is to try and learn from mistakes.

## What I was asked to accomplish:
### Option One: Basic Quiz (Timed Form)

**[Click Here to Watch the Demo](https://youtu.be/fBIj8YsA9dk)**.

* You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

### Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

**[Click Here to Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/xhmmiRmxQ8Q)**.

* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

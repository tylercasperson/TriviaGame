# TriviaGame

When I was studying linguistics in college, an additional thing some of the professors did while pairing us up for activities was to have us count in a different language. The words were simple and we needed to be paired up in groups. This helped us loosen our pronounciation and learn a small part of another language. The best way to learn is to try and learn from mistakes.
